# Silent Tweet
A chrome extension that removes all text from Twitter, leaving only the images. Great for erasing those hot takes and awful statements, but keeping the memes and art.

# Installation

* Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable the "Developer mode" option at the top right of the screen.
* Select "Load Unpacked" at the top left of the screen.
* Select the `SilentTweet` folder.
